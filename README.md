# UPlate â€” Landing Page

Minimal Vite + React + TypeScript landing page for UPlate with a typing effect.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will run on http://localhost:3000 by default (Vite dev server).

Notes

- The typing effect component is in `src/components/TextType.tsx` (uses GSAP for cursor blink animation).
- Background is pure black, text white, minimal modern styling.
